# Streamlit Application for Data Analysis

This project includes a Streamlit application designed for interactive data analysis. The application leverages the Streamlit library to create a web-based interface for exploring and visualizing the dataset.

---

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and run the Streamlit application:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. Additionally, install the necessary libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install streamlit pandas pandas-profiling streamlit-pandas-profiling
```

### Running the Application

1. **Install Streamlit**: Install Streamlit using pip.
   ```bash
   !pip install streamlit -q
   ```

2. **Check IP Address**: Retrieve the IP address (optional).
   ```bash
   !wget -q -O - ipv4.icanhazip.com
   ```

3. **Run Streamlit Application**: Run the Streamlit application. Here, `demo.py` or `app.py` is the name of your Streamlit application file.
   ```bash
   !streamlit run /content/demo.py & npx localtunnel --port 8501
   ```

4. **Localtunnel for Public URL**: Use Localtunnel to make the application accessible via a public URL.
   ```bash
   !streamlit run /content/app.py & npx localtunnel --port 8501
   ```

### Example Application

The example code below demonstrates how to run a Streamlit application named `app.py`:

```bash
!pip install streamlit pandas pandas-profiling streamlit-pandas-profiling
!streamlit run /content/app.py & npx localtunnel --port 8501
```
